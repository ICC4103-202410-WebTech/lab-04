# lab-04

In this lab, we will learn to write user stories for a Y.com application, similar to Twitter. User stories are brief descriptions of a feature from the user's perspective. They are useful for understanding users' needs and expectations and guiding software development.

## Instructions

Y is a social media platform that allows users to post and communicate through short messages called "Yweets". In this lab, we will create user stories describing the functionalities that a user might desire in this application.

### Requirements
To write effective user stories, we need to consider the following aspects:

- Having a profile where I can configure my user.
- Creating "Yweets" with a maximum of 255 characters.
- Being able to view "Yweets" from other users and interact with them (comment, like, tag other users).
- "Yweets" should be able to accept links, photos, etc.
- Searching tweets through hashtags and also viewing the most used hashtags of the day.

## Submission

You must deliver all the necessary user stories to meet all the features that the Y.com application must have. You must understand that there are explicit and implicit requirements.

User stories must comply with the format "As a [user], I want [functionality], So that [goal]". They should be as precise as possible, and each one should fulfill a user functionality.


## User Story

You must complete this field with all necessary user stories:

1. As a [user type], I want [functionality], So that [goal].
2.  
3. 

There is no maximum limit of user stories. They will be evaluated based on meeting the given requirements and the completeness of your stories
